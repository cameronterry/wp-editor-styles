== Description ==

A very simple plugin which allows users to choose a color scheme for their writing experience.

This plugin adds a simple dropdown to the Profile screen under the heading 'Editor Styles' and allows a user to quickly choose a theme which will add a different background color and font color to the Posts text editor.

PLEASE NOTE; this will NOT alter the theme in any shape or form.  It will only change the TinyMCE editor and the Distraction Free Writing Mode (DFWM) screen.

== Installation ==
1. Upload the files to the '/wp-content/plugins/editor-styles/' directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
